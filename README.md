# Design Patterns

This is a demo repository. It contains all [23 traditional design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) of the object-oriented design paradigm.

It currently includes examples of each pattern in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Examples in other languages ​​may be included in the future.

## Project Structure

The first level of this project is designed to contain folders for each programming language.

Within the folder of a given language, the patterns are divided by category into `behavioral`, `creational`, and `structural` directories.

The `test` folder follows this same structure, including a test suite for each pattern.

## TypeScript Commands

**Running tests**
```shell
npm run test
```
